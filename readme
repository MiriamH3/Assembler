========================================

Overview:
This projects represents a 15-bit assembler, from .as to .ob.

Files:

Source files:
- assembler.c: 	 main function, gets the files from command line, freeing alocaited memory.

- pre_processor.c: process the macros in the as file, reports errors if any and creates new am file.

- first_pass.c: 	 includes the related functions of the first pass flow.

- second_pass.c:	 includes the related functions of the second pass flow.

- inst_error_check.c: Includes the functions that check the correctness of the input - command lines.
		 
Header files:
- pre_processor.h: Includes a declaration of the data structure of saving macros - a linked list, and declarations of the preprocessor functions.

- first_pass.h: Include declataition of functions for first pass and a declaration of structs: 
                codeword - bitfield of 15 bits for codewords 
                lable - for intialized lables contains: struct lablename and address-the intialization adress , lble type (if before command or instruction)  
                unknown_lables-  struct for lables that are used in command in firstpass contains: name, index -number index in codeword arr that code is not known , 
                              line_num the line inwitch the lable is present. 
                entry_l struct - struct for lables declare as entry contains: lable name ,line in witch is declaired

- second_pass.h: Includes functions declarations of functions in second pass

- inst_error_check.h: Includes declarations for all command-line sanity-checking functions.

Assumptions:
-  A macro name is allowed to be macr In such a situation the program will be executed as usual.  

Comments:
- correct run files and output files are attached
- incorrect run files and output of the errors are attached
